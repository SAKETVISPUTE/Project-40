# Project-40
My work on my project of creating chatgpt from scrath

Week 1: Data Science Tools
I refreshed my Python skills and learned the essential data science libraries. With NumPy, I understood how to perform efficient array operations and mathematical computations that form the backbone of neural networks. Pandas taught me how to handle and preprocess text data, which is crucial for training language models. I also learned data visualization using Matplotlib to plot training metrics and analyze model performance. Setting up VS Code as my development environment made the coding process much smoother.
Week 2-3: Neural Networks Fundamentals
These two weeks were focused on understanding how neural networks work from the ground up. I learned about the basic building blocks - neurons, layers, and how information flows through networks. The concept of backpropagation became clear, showing how networks learn by adjusting weights based on errors. I understood different activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques like gradient descent. The math behind neural networks, including matrix operations and derivatives, started making sense as I saw how they connect to the actual implementation.
Week 4: Advanced Neural Network Concepts
This week I dove deeper into more sophisticated neural network architectures and training techniques. I learned about regularization methods to prevent overfitting, different types of layers, and how to structure deeper networks. The concepts of batch normalization, dropout, and various optimization algorithms like Adam became clearer. I also understood how to evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters effectively.
Week 5: PyTorch Framework
The final week introduced me to PyTorch, the framework I'll use to implement ChatGPT. I learned how to define neural network models using PyTorch's nn.Module, create custom datasets and data loaders, and implement training loops. Understanding tensors, automatic differentiation with autograd, and GPU acceleration gave me the practical tools needed for implementation. I also learned how to save and load models, which is essential for working with large language models.

I have mostly learnt by watching the videos provided for these 5 weeks by our mentor, there were as such no coding required till now, but would be required henceforth. Hence I havent attached any code.
